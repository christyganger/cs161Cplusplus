Find two syntax errors in the following program:

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int area(int length, int width = 0);

int main()
{
    int length, width;

        // for rectangle use both arguments
    cout << "Enter length and width of a rectangle" << endl;
    cin >> length >> width;

    cout << "The area is " << area(length, width) << endl;

      // for square, only need first argument
    cout << "Enter side of a square" << endl;
    cin >> length;

    cout << "The area is " << area(length) << endl;

    return 0;
}

int area(int length, int width = 0);
{
    if ( width == 0 )
        return length * length;

    return length * width;

Find the errors in the following program. You must use pass by reference.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void area2(int area, int length, int width = 0);

int main()
{
    int length, width, area;

      // for rectangle use two arguments
    cout << "Enter length and width of a rectangle" << endl;
    cin >> length >> width;

    cout << "The area is " << area2(area, length, width) << endl;

      // for squares use one argument
    cout << "Enter side of a square" << endl;
    cin >> length;

    cout << "The area is " << area2(area, length) << endl;

    return 0;
}

void area2(int area, int length, int width)
{
    if ( width == 0 )
        area = length * length;
    else
        area = length * width;
}

Write a simple program with functions that calculates the perimeter and area of a square.

You will need two functions:

Get an integer from the user and return it to the main program (no validation required)
Calculate the area and perimeter of the square and return both to the main program (the length of a side is passed in as a parameter)
Main will call the first function and pass its value to the second function.  It will then call the second function, save the results, and display them with using a cout statement.

Your second function should not do any I/O.  Just get a number from main, calculate the results, and return them.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void square_info(int length, int square_peri, int square_area);

int main()
{
int length, square_peri = 0, square_area = 0;


cout << "Lets calculate the perimeter and area of a square" << "\n";
cout << "please enter the size of a side" << "\n";
cin >> length;
square_info(length, square_area, square_peri);
cout << "the perm is " << square_peri << " the area is " << square_area << "\n";

return 0;
}

void square_info(int length, int &square_peri, int &square_area)
{
square_peri = length * 4;
square_area = length * 2;
return;
}
